 # 2. ReactJs
 
   ##  React Fundamentals
   * What is React ?
       >> Open Source library for building user interfaces 
       >> Not a framework
       >> 
       >> Rich ecosystem
       >> 
       >> ES6 - let&const, arrow functions, template literals, default parameters, object literals, rest and spread operators and destructing assignment.
       >> 
       >> npx is npm package runner
       >> 
       >> Document Object Module(DOM)
          
       | MSA  |  SPA | 
       | :---        |    :----:   |   
       | Multi-Page Application | Single-Page Appication|  
       
       
       
       >> Functional Components / Class Components
       
       | Functional Components  | Class Components | 
       | :---        |    :----:   |   
       | Simple Functions  | More feature rich | 
       | Use Func components (as possible)   | Maintain their own private data - state|
       | Absence of 'this' keyword |  Complex UI logic |
       | Solution without using state | Provide lifecycle hooks |
       | Mainly responsible for the UI	| Stateful / Smart / Container|
       | Stateless/ Dumb/ Presentational | |
       
   * JSX 
        >> JavaScript XML (JSX) - Extension to the JavaScript langugage syntax.
        >> 
        >> Write XML-like code for elements and components
        >> 
        >> JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children
        >> 
        >> JSX is not a necessity to write React application
        >> 
        >> JSX makes your react code simpler and elegant
        >> 
        >> JSX ultimately transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by the browsers. 
        >>
